## Description
This program lets you edit objects like actors, tracks, zones inside a scene.

You can also code new scripts for each actor in each scene. This program opens LBA1 and LBA2 scene files, but the LBA2 support in this current version is only experimental and isn't all compatible.

This release have special features to use with LBArchitect Builder Scene mode, so I advice to download LBArchitect also.

Both programs will work together for now on and should never be work separatly for an easy use of Story Coder.
